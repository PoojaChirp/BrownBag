                            <li>To provide a context for this presentation, we'll first need to go back in time and take a quick look at what HTML was originally developed for. We'll briefly discuss Javascript's evolution as well. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then we will review the way we currently use Javascript. We'll explore why jQuery, DOJO and other libraries have come into existence. But the underlying issues with the Front End development haven't been accounted for. User and Business expectations have changed over the years. That created an opportunity for JS to take the center stage and play a crucial role in the web development stack, whose evolution is currently in progress.

                            </li>
                            <li>Numerous javascript based projects have sprung up  including Ember, AngularJS, Backbone etc. in the recent years. We will closely study Angular JS, a meta framework called neatly showcases the paradigm shift in the way we can use javascript.</li>
                            <li>We will talk about what AngularJS brings to the table, its core philosophy and way it addresses the problems that Front End developers have been facing because of the limitations of HTML. AngularJS takes a completely different approach while focusing on reusability, testability and maintainability. We will then discuss what this new paradigm means for all of us and the changes that we can expect.</li>

                            <li>November 1995: Vendors unite to form a new group dedicated to developing an HTML standard which will be dismantled in a couple of years since then</li>
                            <li>November 1995: Style sheets for HTML documents begin to take shape</li>
                            <li>December 1997: HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation</li>
                            <li>January 2008: HTML5 was published as a Working Draft (link) by the W3C - Still a work in progress</li>
                            <li>September 2012: W3C proposed a plan[29] to release a stable HTML5 Recommendation by the end of 2014 and an HTML 5.1 specification Recommendation by the end of 2016</li>

                            These milestones are familiar to us. So briefly speaking, HTML since its widespread adaption in the 90s hasn't changed much till 2008 till the inception of HTML5. I did not mention the failed xhtml branch as it has no significance anymore. Let's quickly review HTML5.

                            HTML5 development has been chaotic so far. I guess these are some ways to summarize how the HTML5 development was handled so far.  We need to review one more item to get to the crux of this Brownbag's topic. That item is JavaScript. Let's get to it right now.

                            Here are some of the features of Javascript that need to be grasped before one attempts to fully understand JavaScript. Except for borrowing many names and naming conventions from Java, it has not much in common with Java. It in fact is closer to LISP than it is to Java. It is Lisp in C's clothing. JavaScript is loosely typed, very expressive, has prototypal nature, is dynamically typed and has class free objects. In JavaScript, Functions are first class citizens which gives it an immense power and also troubles developers coming in from a Java background who are not fully familiar with JavaScript.

                            The content on this slide is  familiar to most of of us. Introduction of JSON & AJAX have revolutionized the way we use JavaScript. Standardization of JavaScript has been problematic thanks to its proliferation over the years  with various dialects and versions of ECMAScript, JavaScript and jScript floating around as all browsers differed in what they supported.

                            The way we traditionally used JavaScript over the years has been to enhance the user experience by catching user generated browser events like clicking a button and subsequently updating or modifying the DOM after either making an AJAX call or just by changing the way the UI looks without reloading the page. Simple usecases include everything from prevalidation of form data before sending it to the server to server for final validation & processing to catching a button click event then perform an AJAX call and display the server returned data to the user without a page refresh. Pretty much anything dynamic in the browser has to happen with the support of JavaScript. But because of proliferation

                            <li>Increase in scope and complexity of web apps over time with the introduction of AJAX, severe limitations of HTML and a stale and stuck version upgrade process to support the development of highly interactive and catch up with the changes happening to JavaScript, Proliferation of JavaScript dialects among browsers, lack of adoption of suitable alternatives to JS have all led to rethink how we perceive JavaScript</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In an ideal world where browsers play nice, jQuery shouldn't have an existence. But it does exist to make Front End development less hellish for developers. jQuery fills some of the gaps occurred because of JS proliferation which should not have happened.</li>

                                    <li>Reusability: As we end up tying the DOM (manipulation, attachment) to Business logic</li>
                                    <li>Testability: Limits our ability to test when business logic is tied to DOM element structure (IDs, Classes etc.)</li>
                                    <li>Maintainability: No proper native development paradigm coupled with increasing business need for highly interactive and complex workflows and lack of adaption of proper design patterns increases the lines of source code without proper organization making it extremely difficult to maintain over time.</li>

                        <aside class='notes'>
Angular JS represents one such framework which embraces this new paradigm. Actually all the frameworks listed in the previous slides embody similar goals but with different philosophies. So it is perfectly fine if one wants to try out Ember or Backbone or any other project. Each of these technologies have their own strengths and weaknesses but they all do bring a lot of value to the table. But I personally believe that Angular promotes an organic solution to the existing problem by borrowing time tested design principles and practices from the backend and creating an End to End solution for developing Front end web apps. It has gathered a lot of attention and support from Developers in the recent years. Studying it will provide insights into some of the ways these frameworks attempt to solve some of the problems with abstraction. So what is Angular JS anyway?

                        Angular borrows a lot of design practices from several backend technologies like Java, Spring and others. It supports a modular architecture in designing front End web apps using MV* design pattern. So in Angular you hear a lot about Modules, Controllers, Views and Services. All of these components are wired together using the Dependency Injection design pattern. Angular supports testing from the ground up. Since DI is supported, writing tests becomes much easier. You can use the mocks that come with the Angular source to bootstrap your test environment. There is also an eco-system of tools to perform build tasks, dependency management just like we use Maven or Gradle in the backend. Angular promotes Declarative style of programming for the frontend as opposted to an imperative style which is best suited for the backend. This reduces linking DOM with JS code. Let's take a closer look.

Before we see checkout what's under the hood, lets take a high level view of how an Angular based App would be structured and see how its components interact with each other. 
Here we have an Angular Client consuming a REST API. An Angular client can have one or more modules. A module acts as a container for other AngularJS managed objects 
(controllers, services, and so on) and manages their lifecycle. Here we have a view (an html partial), a controller and a service. A controller has a $scope variable which acts as the glue between the controller and the view to enable two way data binding. The Route maps each URL to a View (html partial) and a Controller.

When a URL is invoked, a new instance of its associated Controller is created. The controller is injected with all of its dependencies(The service in this case) including a new child $scope variable inherited from the $rootScope. The service interacts with the REST Api using $resource and returns the response to the Controller. The view which is bound to the controller using $scope will now show the updated data coming in from the interaction with the REST api.

                            Those of you who  have worked with Flex or WPF may be already familiar with Data Binding.It is very simple. You have a model (data) specific to your application and you bind this model to a template and let the templating engine generate the views for you.

                                <li>  Here I have a very simple model with a profile of Tony Stark and it's bound to two templates which generated the two views. Now the interesting part about this is that this is not a one time link between the view and the model. It is a live system where if I modify the model, the templating engine will observe this change and will update the view automatically. I don't need to go update the view every time the model changes. And it also works the other way around. So if you have two way data binding and you bind the model to the form like I have in the second view. If the user starts interacting with the form and starts changing the form content, the changes will be propagated automatically to the model. And because I have a second view bound to the same model, these changes will go back to the second view where it will be reflected automatically.</li>
                                <li>It can get more advanced if you start dealing with Arrays and Collections </li>

                            Let's say I have an array of 3 superheroes and I bind it to a template using a repeating construct built into Angular. What I'm telling the templating engine to do is to iterate through all the elements of the array, tie each element to the template. What you get out of this is this generated view of 3 super herores. And its not a one time thing. Lets say you push a new object into this array or you remove an object from the array or simply modify the contents of the array, the changes will be automatically reflected in the view. You don't have to do anything to manage the view once the two-way data binding is enabled.

                            With data binding you can remove a lot of javascript code from your application. Because when you look at a typical application, about 70 to 80% of all the js is synchronizing the model with the view and updating the model with the changes in the view. All of this code can go away. So Angular teaches browser how to do data binding using existing api's. Google is actually creating a specification to propose this two way data binding feature to be built into next generation web browsers.

                            HTML can be very verbose sometimes. Let's take a simple example. Let's say that I would like to create a neat tab system in my application with Bootstrap CSS. In order to generate a simple component like this, I need to copy paste this chunk of html to get this view. This is not ideal. HTML has a limited set of vocabulary and often comes short when we want to build some basic components like Accordions or tabs natively. Also this is not maintainable. You have to copy/paste it again, change the div ids etc. If the template changes you need to go to all the places where it is used and change it.

                            So what I want in my html template is to specify a custom tag say "tab" and just tell the browser to render tabs. I want this page to have two tabs and each tab will have a title. You figure out what the underlying DOM structure needs to be generated. This is something that is supported by angular. This concept of reusable code is called Directives.

Working with these modern Javascript libraries and frameworks require using JavaScript in its native form. I come from a Java background and the transition hasn't been a smooth ride for me. When dealing with JavaScript, not thinking in a Functional way is bound to give you a rough ride. Also as expressive JavaScript is, it is plauged with a lot of bad parts. I recommend grabbing a copy of either "JavaScript: The Good Parts" or "JavaScript Enlightenment guide".It is imperative to steer away from these bad parts and embrace functional thinking. And finally JavaScript is here to stay. Being in denial is not going to help.

                                            application model inside the Angular execution context.</li>
                                        <li>Angular applies the <code>name = 'X';</code> to the model.</li>

                                            on the <code>name</code> property and notifies the <a href="api/ng.$interpolate"><code>{{name}}</code></a> interpolation, which in turn updates the DOM.</li>
                                        <li>Angular exits the execution context, which in turn exits the <code>keydown</code> event and with it
                                            the JavaScript execution context.</li>
                                        <li>The browser re-renders the view with update text.</li></ol></li>
                            </ol>
                            Let's understand another angular concept called $scope. After that we'll build a nice little TODO app.

                            <li>The backend is a Java EE application built using Spring. The persistence layer is built upon JPA with Hibernate as its provider.

                            <li>MySQL is the persistence store. Although the application can use any RDBMS data provider</li>
                            <li>The default Application server for the service is Tomcat although any Java Web container will do fine.</li>
