                            <li>To provide a context for this presentation, we'll first need to go back in time and take a quick look at what HTML was originally developed for. We'll briefly look at Javascript's evolution as well. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then we will review the way we currently use Javascript. We'll explore why jQuery, DOJO and other libraries have come into existence. But the underlying issues with the Front End development stack still persist. User and Business expectations have changed over the years. That created an opportunity for JS to take the center stage and play a prominent role in the web development stack, whose evolution is currently in progress.
                                This is the paradigm shift in the the way we use JavScript which will be the focus of this presentation.
                            </li>
                            <li>Numerous javascript based projects have sprung up  including Ember, AngularJS, Backbone etc. We will closely study Angular JS, a meta framework called neatly showcases the paradigm shift in the way we can use javascript.</li>
                            <li>We will talk about what AngularJS brings to the table, its core philosophy and way it addresses the problems that Front End developers have been facing because of the limitations of HTML. AngularJS takes a completely different approach while focusing on reusability, testability and maintainability. We will then discuss some challenges that this paradigm shift creates</li>

                                      <li>But the key takeaway from this slide is that HTML was originally designed to show static documents on the web and not much more.</li>

                                        <li>1989: Tim Berners-Lee invents the Web with HTML as its publishing language</li>
                                        <li>Late 1994: The World Wide Web Consortium forms</li>
                                        <li>November 1995: Vendors unite to form a new group dedicated to developing an HTML standard which will be dismantled in a couple of years since then</li>
                                        <li>November 1995: Style sheets for HTML documents begin to take shape</li>
                                        <li>December 1997: HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation</li>
                                        <li>January 2008: HTML5 was published as a Working Draft (link) by the W3C - Still a work in progress</li>
                                        <li>September 2012: W3C proposed a plan[29] to release a stable HTML5 Recommendation by the end of 2014 and an HTML 5.1 specification Recommendation by the end of 2016</li>

                                        These milestones are familiar to us. So briefly speaking, HTML since its widespread adaption in the 90s hasn't changed much till 2008 with the inception of HTML5. I did not mention the failed xhtml branch as it has no significance anymore. Let's quickly review HTML5.

                                        HTML5 development has been chaotic so far. I guess these are some ways to summarize how the HTML5 development was handled so far.  We need to review one more item to get to the crux of this Brownbag's topic. That item is JavaScript. Let's get to it right now.

                                        Here are some of the features of Javascript that need to be grasped before one attempts to fully understand JavaScript. Except for borrowing many names and naming conventions from Java, it has not much in common with Java. It in fact is closer to LISP than it is to Java. It is Lisp in C's clothing. JavaScript is loosely typed, very expressive, has prototypal nature, is dynamically typed and has class free objects. In JavaScript, Functions are first class citizens which gives it an immense power and also troubles developers coming in from a Java background who are not fully familiar with JavaScript.

                                           The content on this slide is  familiar to most of of us. Introduction of JSON & AJAX have revolutionized the way we use JavaScript. Standardization of JavaScript has been problematic thanks to its proliferation over the years  with various dialects and versions of ECMAScript, JavaScript and jScript floating around as all browsers differed in what they supported.

                                        The way we traditionally used JavaScript over the years has been to enhance the user experience by catching user generated browser events like clicking a button and subsequently updating or modifying the DOM after either making an AJAX call or just by changing the way the UI looks without reloading the page. Simple usecases include everything from prevalidation of form data before sending it to the server to server for final validation & processing to catching a button click event then perform an AJAX call and display the server returned data to the user without a page refresh. Pretty much anything dynamic in the browser has to happen with the support of JavaScript. But because of proliferation

                            Those of you who  have worked with Flex or WPF may be already familiar with Data Binding.It is very simple. You have a model (data) specific to your application and you bind this model to a template and let the templating engine generate the views for you.

                                <li>  Here I have a very simple model with a profile of Tony Stark and it's bound to two templates which generated the two views. Now the interesting part about this is that this is not a one time link between the view and the model. It is a live system where if I modify the model, the templating engine will observe this change and will update the view automatically. I don't need to go update the view every time the model changes. And it also works the other way around. So if you have two way data binding and you bind the model to the form like I have in the second view. If the user starts interacting with the form and starts changing the form content, the changes will be propagated automatically to the model. And because I have a second view bound to the same model, these changes will go back to the second view where it will be reflected automatically.</li>
                                <li>It can get more advanced if you start dealing with Arrays and Collections </li>

                            Let's say I have an array of 3 superheroes and I bind it to a template using a repeating construct built into Angular. What I'm telling the templating engine to do is to iterate through all the elements of the array, tie each element to the template. What you get out of this is this generated view of 3 super herores. And its not a one time thing. Lets say you push a new object into this array or you remove an object from the array or simply modify the contents of the array, the changes will be automatically reflected in the view. You don't have to do anything to manage the view once the two-way data binding is enabled.

                            With data binding you can remove a lot of javascript code from your application. Because when you look at a typical application, about 70 to 80% of all the js is synchronizing the model with the view and updating the model with the changes in the view. All of this code can go away. So Angular teaches browser how to do data binding using existing api's. Google is actually creating a specification to propose this two way data binding feature to be built into next generation web browsers.

                            HTML can be very verbose sometimes. Let's take a simple example. Let's say that I would like to create a neat tab system in my application with Bootstrap CSS. In order to generate a simple component like this, I need to copy paste this chunk of html to get this view. This is not ideal. HTML has a limited set of vocabulary and often comes short when we want to build some basic components like Accordions or tabs natively. Also this is not maintainable. You have to copy/paste it again, change the div ids etc. If the template changes you need to go to all the places where it is used and change it.

                            So what I want in my html template is to specify a custom tag say "tab" and just tell the browser to render tabs. I want this page to have two tabs and each tab will have a title. You figure out what the underlying DOM structure needs to be generated. This is something that is supported by angular. This concept of reusable code is called Directives.

                            And its not just tabs. Think about all these components that you could build using this feature. You can also share it within/outside of your project. These components can be stateless or stateful.
